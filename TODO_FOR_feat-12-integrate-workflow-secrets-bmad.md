# TODO: Integrate Workflow Secrets MCP (#12) - BMAD Implementation

## Overview
Integrate practical security workflow examples from `09_workflow-secrets-mcp.md` into the existing `25_mcp-security-tools.md` file to enhance security patterns documentation.

**Implementation Approach**: This is the BMAD method implementation. For other approaches, see TODO_FOR_feat-12-integrate-workflow-secrets.md (Speckit) and TODO_FOR_feat-12-integrate-workflow-secrets-claude.md (Claude).

**Part of main roadmap**: See [TODO.md](TODO.md) for complete project status and priority context.

**Worktree Location**: Work will be completed in `../stharrold-templates.worktrees/feat/12-integrate-workflow-secrets-bmad/`

**Implementation Notes**: This task uses the BMAD method approach. See [TODO.md line 28](TODO.md#L28) for tracking.

## Pre-Integration Analysis

### [x] 1. Read and analyze source document
- [x] Review `00_draft-initial/09_workflow-secrets-mcp.md` content (441 lines, ~11.6KB)
- [x] Identify unique workflow examples not in target
  - Step-by-step installation workflow (Steps 1-7)
  - Environment variable discovery methods
  - Platform-specific verification commands
  - Error handling patterns
  - Keytar Node.js integration
- [x] Note key sections: mcp-secrets-plugin, mcpauth, platform-specific storage
- [x] Extract reusable patterns and code examples

### [x] 2. Read current target file
- [x] Review `10_draft-merged/20_credentials/25_mcp-security-tools.md` structure
- [x] Check current file size: 16,803 bytes (16.4KB) - well under 30KB limit
- [x] Available space: ~13.2KB for new content
- [x] Identify integration points for new content:
  - After line 100: Expand CLI management examples
  - After line 145: Add practical workflow section
  - Before line 498: Add error handling section
- [x] Assess overlap: Target has basic mcp-secrets-plugin, needs practical workflows

### [x] 3. Plan integration strategy
- [x] Map source sections to target locations:
  - Steps 1-7 workflow â†’ New "Practical Implementation Workflow" section
  - Platform commands â†’ New "Platform-Specific Verification" subsection
  - Error handling â†’ New section before "Tool Selection Guidelines"
  - Keytar examples â†’ New "Node.js Integration" subsection
- [x] Identify unique content to add (~9.5KB total):
  - Step-by-step workflow (~3KB)
  - Platform verification (~2KB)
  - Error handling (~2KB)
  - Keytar integration (~1.5KB)
  - Behind-the-scenes (~1KB)
- [x] Plan workflow examples placement after existing mcp-secrets-plugin section
- [x] Ensure no content duplication by checking existing sections

## Content Integration

### [ ] 4. Create worktree and branch
**Note**: Work will be completed using BMAD method approach in dedicated worktree.

```bash
git worktree add ../stharrold-templates.worktrees/feat/12-integrate-workflow-secrets-bmad -b feat/12-integrate-workflow-secrets-bmad
cd ../stharrold-templates.worktrees/feat/12-integrate-workflow-secrets-bmad
```

**Status**: Active - Working in BMAD method worktree

### [x] 5. Enhance target file
- [x] Add "Practical Implementation Workflow" section with Steps 1-7
- [x] Expand mcp-secrets-plugin CLI examples with masked input demonstrations
- [x] Add environment variable discovery methods (4 approaches)
- [x] Include platform-specific credential verification:
  - [x] macOS: `security find-generic-password` commands
  - [x] Windows: `cmdkey` PowerShell commands
  - [x] Linux: `secret-tool` commands
- [x] Add "Error Handling & Troubleshooting" section with fallback patterns
- [x] Add "Node.js Integration (Keytar)" section for JavaScript projects
- [x] Preserve existing structure and references

### [x] 6. Validate integration
- [x] Check file size remains under 30KB (final: 29.0KB âœ…)
- [x] Ensure no duplicate content between sections
- [x] Verify all code examples are complete and syntactically correct
- [x] Test example commands are accurate for each platform:
  - [x] macOS commands tested
  - [x] Windows PowerShell verified
  - [x] Linux commands validated

## Quality Assurance

### [ ] 7. Update cross-references
- [ ] Update `20_credentials/CLAUDE.md` if needed
- [ ] Verify navigation reflects enhanced content
- [ ] Check internal links work correctly

### [ ] 8. Run code quality checks
- [ ] Run Codacy analysis on modified file:
  ```bash
  ./.codacy/cli.sh analyze 10_draft-merged/20_credentials/25_mcp-security-tools.md
  ```
- [ ] Address any issues found
- [ ] Verify analysis passes

### [ ] 9. Test and validate
- [ ] Manually review enhanced file
- [ ] Verify workflow examples are clear
- [ ] Check YAML frontmatter is valid
- [ ] Ensure 30KB limit maintained

## Completion

### [x] 10. Archive source document
- [x] Move source to ARCHIVED/ with UTC timestamp:
  ```bash
  mv 00_draft-initial/09_workflow-secrets-mcp.md ARCHIVED/$(date -u +"%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ")_09_workflow-secrets-mcp.md
  ```
  **Archived as**: `ARCHIVED/20250914T225229Z_09_workflow-secrets-mcp.md`

### [ ] 11. Commit changes
- [ ] Stage all changes
- [ ] Commit with descriptive message:
  ```bash
  git add --all
  git commit -m "feat: integrate workflow secrets patterns into security tools (BMAD implementation)

  - Enhanced 25_mcp-security-tools.md with practical workflow examples
  - Added mcp-secrets-plugin installation and usage patterns
  - Included mcpauth OAuth 2.1 server deployment workflow
