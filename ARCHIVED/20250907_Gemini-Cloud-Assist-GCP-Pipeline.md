i want to send google documents (code, markdown, pdfs, docx, excel, powerpoint, mp4) and i want google to return resolved entities, semantic relationship, and all under a unified ontology such as schema.org , OWL , RDF . what do you recommend ?
This is an excellent and complex requirement! You're looking to extract rich, semantically structured information from a diverse set of document types, including unstructured and semi-structured data like code, markdown, and various office documents, as well as multimedia like MP4s. Then, you want this information presented in standardized ontological formats.

Here's a breakdown of Google Cloud services and approaches that can help you achieve this, keeping in mind that a single service won't do everything you need, but a combination can get you very close:

1. For Document Understanding and Entity Extraction (Code, Markdown, PDFs, DOCX, Excel, PowerPoint):

Document AI: This is your primary tool for extracting structured data from unstructured and semi-structured documents.
Capabilities: Document AI processors can analyze PDFs, DOCX, and other common document types. They can extract entities, relationships, and even understand document structure (like forms and tables). While there isn't a pre-trained processor specifically for "code" or "markdown" understanding in a semantic way out-of-the-box, you can:
Custom Processors: Train custom Document AI processors to identify specific entities and relationships within your code and markdown files if they follow a consistent structure. This would involve providing labeled examples.
General Processors: For PDFs and DOCX, Document AI has general processors that can extract text, identify entities (like names, addresses, dates), and even analyze layouts.
Output: Document AI provides its output in a structured JSON format, which includes extracted text, entities, and often their positions within the document. This is a crucial first step before mapping to an ontology.
Vertex AI Search (formerly Enterprise Search): While primarily for search, it has strong document parsing capabilities that could be useful for initial ingestion and basic understanding, especially for layout-rich documents.
Capabilities: It can parse various document types (HTML, PDF, DOCX) and even handle OCR for scanned PDFs. It focuses on extracting content and understanding layout.
Relevance: It's more about preparing documents for search and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) than deep semantic understanding for ontological mapping. However, its parsing capabilities can ensure you get clean text and structure from your input files.
Natural Language API: For general text analysis, once you've extracted text from your documents.
Capabilities: It can perform entity extraction, sentiment analysis, syntax analysis, and content classification on raw text.
Relevance: Useful for identifying common entities and their types (e.g., person, organization, location) from the textual content of your documents. This can feed into your ontological mapping.
2. For Multimedia (MP4 - Video/Audio Understanding):

Video Intelligence API:
Capabilities: This API can detect entities, activities, and objects within video content. It can also transcribe speech from the audio track.
Relevance: This is essential for extracting information from MP4s. You can get transcribed text (which can then be processed by Natural Language API) and identify visual elements or events.
Speech-to-Text API:
Capabilities: Highly accurate speech transcription.
Relevance: Directly transcribes the audio from your MP4s into text, which can then be analyzed for entities and relationships using other NLP services.
3. For Resolving Entities, Semantic Relationships, and Ontological Mapping (Schema.org, OWL, RDF):

This is the most custom and complex part, as no single Google Cloud service will directly output in Schema.org, OWL, or RDF from arbitrary documents. You'll need an orchestration and post-processing layer:

Custom Logic (e.g., using Cloud Functions, Cloud Run, or Dataflow):
Orchestration: You'll need to chain the various API calls. For example:
Receive a document (e.g., via Cloud Storage upload).
Route it to the appropriate processor (Document AI for PDFs, Video Intelligence for MP4s, etc.).
Process the extracted raw data (JSON from Document AI, transcript from Speech-to-Text, etc.).
Semantic Mapping Layer: This is where you implement your rules or use machine learning models to map the extracted entities and relationships to your chosen ontology (Schema.org, OWL, RDF).
Rule-based: Define rules to transform extracted entities (e.g., "person name" from Document AI becomes schema:Person with schema:name ).
Knowledge Graphs: Consider building a knowledge graph in a service like Neo4j AuraDB (available via Google Cloud Marketplace) or managing one yourself on Compute Engine. This knowledge graph can store your ontology and the relationships you discover.
ML-based: For more complex or nuanced relationships, you might train custom ML models (e.g., using Vertex AI Workbench or Vertex AI Training ) to identify specific semantic relationships between entities identified by the NLP APIs.
Serialization: Convert the structured data into your desired RDF, OWL, or Schema.org (often as JSON-LD for web use cases) format. There are open-source libraries available in various programming languages for working with these formats (e.g., RDFlib for Python).
Recommended Architecture Flow:

Ingestion: Store your documents in Cloud Storage . Set up Cloud Storage Triggers to invoke a Cloud Function or send messages to Cloud Pub/Sub when new documents are uploaded.
Document/Media Processing:
The triggered Cloud Function (or a Dataflow job for batch processing) determines the file type.
It then calls the appropriate Google Cloud API:
Document AI (for PDFs, DOCX, Excel, PowerPoint - or custom processors for code/markdown if applicable).
Video Intelligence API (for MP4s).
Speech-to-Text API (for audio in MP4s).
Natural Language API (for raw text content extracted from any source).
Intermediate Storage: Store the raw JSON outputs from these APIs in a temporary Cloud Storage bucket or directly in a database like Cloud SQL or Firestore .
Semantic Mapping & Knowledge Graph Population:
Another Cloud Function , Cloud Run service, or Dataflow job processes these intermediate outputs.
This is where your custom logic for mapping to Schema.org/OWL/RDF lives. You'll define the rules or use trained models to interpret the extracted entities and relationships according to your chosen ontology.
Populate a knowledge graph (e.g., in a graph database) with these resolved entities and relationships.
Output & Querying:
Store the final ontological representations (e.g., JSON-LD files in Cloud Storage, or direct RDF triples in a triple store/graph database).
You can then query this knowledge graph using appropriate tools for your chosen ontology format.
Key Considerations and Challenges:

Ontology Definition: Before you start, you need a very clear and well-defined ontology (Schema.org, your custom OWL, or RDF schema). This is crucial for consistent mapping.
Custom Training: For highly specific entity types or relationships (especially in code, markdown, or business-specific documents), you will likely need to train custom models using Vertex AI (e.g., for custom entity extraction or relationship extraction).
Ambiguity and Context: Understanding semantic relationships, especially from unstructured text, is challenging. You'll need robust logic to handle ambiguity and infer context.
Schema.org vs. OWL/RDF: Schema.org is primarily for web content markup. OWL and RDF are more general-purpose knowledge representation languages. Choose the one that best fits your consumption needs. For internal knowledge management, OWL/RDF might be more powerful. For making content discoverable on the web, Schema.org is key.
Cost: Running multiple AI APIs and custom processing can incur significant costs, especially with large volumes of documents. Design your architecture efficiently.
This approach leverages Google Cloud's powerful AI/ML capabilities for initial understanding and then requires a custom layer to perform the sophisticated semantic mapping and ontological representation you're looking for.

Thanks for your feedback.

good . what if we just use "natural language api" json stored raw in spanner ?
That's an interesting simplification! Let's explore the implications of using only Natural Language API output stored raw in Spanner.

Pros of this approach:

Simplicity (Initial): It reduces the number of distinct processing steps and specialized services. You're essentially taking the output of one API and storing it directly.
Scalability & Global Consistency (Spanner): Spanner is excellent for globally distributed, strongly consistent data. If your documents and their NLP outputs need to be accessible with low latency and high availability across multiple regions, Spanner is a strong choice.
Schema Flexibility (JSON in Spanner): Spanner supports JSON columns, so you can store the raw Natural Language API output directly without needing to pre-define a rigid schema for every possible NLP annotation. This is a significant advantage given the potentially varied structure of NLP results.
Cons and Challenges of this approach:

Limited Document Type Support:
Natural Language API Input: The Natural Language API primarily works with text . It doesn't inherently understand the structure of PDFs, DOCX, Excel, PowerPoint, or the visual/audio content of MP4s.
Preprocessing Still Needed: You would still need a preprocessing step to extract text from these diverse document types.
PDFs/DOCX/PPTX/XLSX: You'd need services like Document AI (for structured extraction) or custom parsers (e.g., using Apache POI libraries on Cloud Functions/Run) to get the raw text.
MP4s: You'd need Video Intelligence API and/or Speech-to-Text API to transcribe audio and extract visual cues into text.
Loss of Context/Structure: By reducing everything to raw text for NLP API and then storing its JSON output, you might lose valuable structural information (e.g., table layouts from Excel, slide structure from PowerPoint, code block formatting from markdown) that isn't captured by the NLP API's text-centric analysis. This structural context is often vital for true "document understanding."
Ontological Mapping Complexity (Shifted, Not Eliminated):
Raw NLP Output vs. Ontology: The Natural Language API output (entities, sentiment, syntax) is not directly in Schema.org, OWL, or RDF. It's a Google-specific JSON structure.
Post-processing Required: You would still need a separate processing layer (e.g., Cloud Functions, Cloud Run, or Dataflow) after storing in Spanner to:
Read the NLP JSON from Spanner.
Parse it.
Apply your mapping logic to transform Google's entity types (e.g., PERSON , LOCATION ) and relationships into your desired ontological terms (e.g., schema:Person , schema:Place ).
Generate the OWL/RDF/Schema.org triples/JSON-LD.
Potentially store these transformed ontological representations elsewhere (e.g., in a dedicated graph database, or back into another Spanner table if you design a suitable schema).
Querying & Analytics:
JSON Querying in Spanner: While Spanner supports JSON functions for querying, querying deeply nested JSON structures for complex semantic relationships can be less efficient and more cumbersome than querying a dedicated graph database designed for ontological data (like a triple store or property graph database).
No Native Graph Capabilities: Spanner is a relational database. It doesn't have native graph traversal capabilities that are often ideal for querying semantic relationships defined in ontologies.
Revised Architecture with "Natural Language API + Spanner" Focus:

Ingestion & Preprocessing (Same as before):
Cloud Storage: Documents uploaded here.
Cloud Functions/Cloud Run: Triggered by new uploads.
Document AI / Video Intelligence / Speech-to-Text: Used to extract raw text and basic metadata from various document types.
Crucial Step: This layer would then feed the extracted text to the Natural Language API.
NLP Processing & Raw Storage:
Natural Language API: Processes the extracted text and returns its JSON output.
Spanner: The raw JSON output from the Natural Language API, along with a reference to the original document and any basic metadata, is stored in a Spanner table (e.g., document_nlp_results with columns like document_id , nlp_output_json JSON , processed_timestamp ).
Ontological Transformation (Still Required):
Cloud Functions/Cloud Run/Dataflow: A separate process (triggered by new Spanner rows, or on a schedule) reads the nlp_output_json from Spanner.
Custom Logic: This code applies your mapping rules to convert the Natural Language API's entities and relationships into your target ontology (Schema.org, OWL, RDF).
Output Storage: The transformed ontological data would then be stored. Options:
Another Spanner table: If you can flatten your ontology into a relational schema.
Cloud Storage: As JSON-LD or RDF files.
Dedicated Graph Database: If you need complex graph queries (e.g., Neo4j AuraDB, or a self-managed graph DB on GCE).
Conclusion:

Using Natural Language API and storing its raw JSON in Spanner simplifies the storage aspect and leverages Spanner's strengths. However, it does not eliminate the need for significant preprocessing to get diverse document types into a text format consumable by NLP API, nor does it eliminate the need for a custom transformation layer to map the NLP API's output to your desired ontological formats.

The core challenge of semantic and ontological mapping remains a custom development effort, regardless of whether you store the intermediate NLP results in Spanner or elsewhere. Spanner would be a good choice if the primary requirement for the raw NLP output is global consistency and high-scale transactional access, but it doesn't inherently solve the ontological mapping problem.

Do you want to proceed with a design that focuses on this "Natural Language API + Spanner" core, understanding that the preprocessing and ontological mapping layers would be custom components?

good . what do you recommend for storing the raw output of "natural language api" such that all documents with similar entity regardless of depth are identified (requires similarity search)
You've hit on a critical point: similarity search within the raw Natural Language API output. Storing it in Spanner is great for structured queries and transactional consistency, but it's not optimized for semantic similarity.

To effectively identify documents with "similar entities regardless of depth" (which implies semantic similarity beyond exact string matches), you need a different approach for that specific query pattern.

Here's what I recommend for storing and querying the raw Natural Language API output to enable similarity search, while still leveraging the strengths of GCP:

The Core Idea: Vector Embeddings for Similarity Search

The key to similarity search is converting your data (in this case, the NLP API output or the underlying text) into numerical representations called vector embeddings . These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text, and similar meanings are represented by vectors that are "close" to each other in a multi-dimensional space.

Recommended Architecture for Similarity Search:

Ingestion & Preprocessing (as discussed):
Cloud Storage: Documents (code, markdown, PDFs, etc.) are uploaded.
Cloud Functions/Cloud Run: Triggered by uploads.
Document AI / Video Intelligence / Speech-to-Text: Extract raw text from various document types.
Natural Language API Processing & Initial Storage:
Natural Language API: Processes the extracted text, providing its JSON output (entities, sentiment, syntax).
Cloud Storage (for raw NLP JSON): Store the raw JSON output from the Natural Language API here. This is a cost-effective and highly scalable way to archive the original NLP results. Each document's NLP output can be stored as a separate JSON file.
Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL (for metadata and structured queries): Store metadata about the document (e.g., original filename, timestamp, document type, a reference to its raw NLP JSON in GCS) and any structured, queryable elements you want to extract from the NLP output (e.g., primary entities, categories). This is where Spanner could fit if you need global consistency for this metadata, but for many use cases, Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL with pgvector extension) is more suitable for vector search.
Vector Embedding Generation:
Vertex AI Embeddings API (Text Embeddings): This is the crucial component for similarity search.
After getting the text from your preprocessing step (and potentially after NLP API processing), feed the relevant text segments (e.g., entire document text, or specific entity descriptions from the NLP output) to the Vertex AI Embeddings API.
This API will return high-dimensional numerical vectors (embeddings) that represent the semantic meaning of the text.
Vector Database for Similarity Search:
Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL with pgvector extension: This is an excellent choice for storing your vector embeddings alongside your document metadata.
You can create a table in PostgreSQL that stores document_id , the vector embedding , and any other relevant metadata.
The pgvector extension allows you to perform efficient nearest-neighbor searches (similarity searches) on these vectors.
Vertex AI Vector Search (formerly Matching Engine): For very large-scale (millions to billions of vectors) and high-performance similarity search, Vertex AI Vector Search is the managed solution.
You'd export your embeddings from your processing pipeline and import them into a Vertex AI Vector Search index.
This service is optimized for low-latency, high-throughput similarity queries.
Querying for Similarity:
When a user wants to find similar documents (e.g., "find all documents related to 'cloud security best practices'"), you would:
Take the user's query text.
Generate an embedding for the query using the Vertex AI Embeddings API .
Perform a similarity search in your Cloud SQL (pgvector) or Vertex AI Vector Search index using the query embedding.
The search will return document_ids of the most semantically similar documents.
You can then retrieve the full raw NLP JSON from Cloud Storage for these document_ids if needed for detailed analysis or ontological mapping.
Why this approach addresses "similarity search":

Semantic Understanding: Vector embeddings capture meaning, not just keywords. So, "cloud security" will be semantically close to "GCP hardening" even if the exact words aren't present.
Scalability: Both Cloud SQL with pgvector and Vertex AI Vector Search are designed for scalable vector storage and retrieval.
Integration: It integrates well with other GCP services.
Summary of Storage Recommendations:

Raw Natural Language API JSON: Cloud Storage (cost-effective, highly scalable archive).
Document Metadata & Vector Embeddings: Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL with pgvector (for structured queries and efficient similarity search).
Very Large-Scale Vector Search: Vertex AI Vector Search (if you anticipate millions/billions of documents and need extreme performance).
This hybrid approach gives you the best of both worlds: durable, cost-effective storage for raw NLP outputs, structured query capabilities for metadata, and powerful semantic similarity search.

Would you like to proceed with a design that incorporates this vector embedding and similarity search capability?

"Ingestion & Preprocessing" good as is . "Natural Language API Processing & Initial Storage" what if no "Store metadata about the document" . this way when user queries, their query goes through the same ( save-storage, , trigger-function, extract-text , process-language , save-storage, apply-embedding ) process with added ( vector-search, read-documents ) ?
That's an interesting thought process for optimizing storage and processing!

Let's break down your proposal: "what if no 'Store metadata about the document'. this way when user queries, their query goes through the same ( save-storage, trigger-function, extract-text , process-language , save-storage, apply-embedding ) process with added ( vector-search, read-documents ) ?"

If I understand correctly, you're suggesting that for the source documents (the ones you're ingesting: code, markdown, PDFs, etc.):

We would still perform the initial ingestion, text extraction, Natural Language API processing, and generate vector embeddings .
We would store these vector embeddings (e.g., in Cloud SQL with pgvector or Vertex AI Vector Search) so they can be searched.
However, we would NOT store the raw JSON output from the Natural Language API for these source documents.
Then, when a user submits a query:
The query text itself goes through a similar pipeline (extract text, process with Natural Language API, generate embedding).
This query embedding is used to perform a vector-search against the pre-stored document embeddings .
Once similar documents are identified, if you need to see the detailed NLP analysis (entities, relationships) for those retrieved documents, you would then read-documents (the original source files) and re-run the Natural Language API on them on-demand.
Is my understanding correct?

If so, this approach is certainly feasible and offers a trade-off:

Pros:

Storage Savings: You save storage space by not persisting the potentially large JSON outputs from the Natural Language API for every ingested document.
Cons:

Increased Latency on Retrieval: When a user queries and similar documents are found, retrieving the detailed NLP analysis for those documents would require re-processing them through the Natural Language API. This adds latency to the retrieval step, as opposed to simply fetching a pre-computed JSON file from storage.
Increased API Costs on Retrieval: Every time you need the detailed NLP analysis for a retrieved document, you'd incur the cost of re-running the Natural Language API. If documents are frequently retrieved and their full NLP analysis is often needed, this could become more expensive than storing the results initially.
This design makes sense if the primary goal is similarity search, and the detailed NLP output is only occasionally needed, or if storage costs for the NLP JSON are a major concern.

Please let me know if I've captured your intent correctly!

save raw JSON output from the Natural Language API to storage as cache to minimize api calls . use gcp native form of redis to for repeated "query-string" to "document-guid"
Okay, I apologize for the previous error. I will ensure the response includes the correct structured function calls.

Here's the proposed architecture for your document intelligence solution, incorporating caching strategies for both NLP outputs and query results:

Document Ingestion & NLP Processing:
Your raw documents (code, markdown, PDFs, etc.) will be stored in a Cloud Storage bucket .
A Cloud Run service will handle the ingestion, text extraction, and call the Natural Language API.
The raw JSON output from the Natural Language API will be saved to a separate Cloud Storage bucket acting as a cache. This avoids re-processing the same document through the NLP API.
Vector Embedding & Metadata Storage:
The Cloud Run service will also generate vector embeddings (using Vertex AI Embeddings API) from the processed text.
These embeddings, along with document metadata, will be stored in Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL (configured with pgvector for efficient similarity search).
Query Result Caching:
A Memorystore for Redis instance will be used to cache the results of user queries. When a user submits a query, the system will first check Redis. If the exact query string has been seen before, the cached list of document GUIDs will be returned directly, bypassing the vector search and document retrieval steps.
This design provides a robust, scalable, and cost-optimized solution for your requirements.

Here is the initial design:

A diagram of the application's architecture. It represents components used in the application and connections between them.
List of components:
document-ingestion-processor (doc-ingestion-service)
raw-documents-bucket (doc-ingestion-gcs-bucket)
document-query-service (doc-search-service)
document-vector-db (doc-search-database-postgresql)
document-db-credentials (doc-search-database-secret)
query-result-cache (doc-search-cache)
nlp-json-cache-bucket (doc-ingestion-nlp-cache-bucket)
List of connections:
doc-ingestion-service -> doc-ingestion-gcs-bucket
doc-search-service -> doc-search-database-postgresql
doc-search-service -> doc-search-cache
doc-search-service -> doc-search-database-secret
doc-search-database-secret -> doc-search-database-postgresql
doc-ingestion-service -> doc-ingestion-nlp-cache-bucket
doc-search-service -> doc-ingestion-nlp-cache-bucket
good . but store (guid, vector embeddings) in vertex search .
You got it. We'll update the design to use Vertex AI Vector Search for storing your document embeddings, replacing the PostgreSQL database for that specific function. This will provide a highly scalable and optimized solution for similarity search.

Here's the updated design:

A diagram of the application's architecture. It represents components used in the application and connections between them.
List of components:
document-ingestion-processor (doc-ingestion-service)
raw-documents-bucket (doc-ingestion-gcs-bucket)

doc-search-service -> vertex-ai-vector-search
good . will this implementation be able to identify ( user query subsection requests metric x1 ) and ( database document subsection defines metric x2 which is similar to x1 ) so ( response to user with subsection of database document ) ?
Yes, this architecture is well-suited to achieve that level of granular, semantic search and retrieval.

Here's how the proposed implementation would handle identifying similar subsections and returning them:

Granular Embedding During Ingestion:
The document-ingestion-service (Cloud Run) would be designed to not just process the entire document, but to intelligently break it down into meaningful "subsections" (e.g., paragraphs, code blocks, table rows, specific sections identified by headings).
For each of these subsections, it would:
Extract the text content.
Generate a vector embedding for that specific subsection using the Vertex AI Embeddings API.
Store this subsection embedding in Vertex AI Vector Search , along with metadata linking it back to the original document and its precise location/identifier within that document (e.g., document_guid , subsection_id , start_char_offset , end_char_offset ).
Query Processing and Subsection Search:
When a user submits a query like "user query subsection requests metric x1", the document-query-service (Cloud Run) would:
First, check the Memorystore for Redis cache for an exact match of the query string. If found, it returns the cached document GUIDs.
If not cached, it generates a vector embedding for the user's query using the Vertex AI Embeddings API.
It then performs a similarity search in Vertex AI Vector Search against the subsection embeddings . This search will identify subsections whose semantic meaning (like "metric x2") is closest to the user's query ("metric x1").
Contextual Response:
The vector search will return the subsection_id (and potentially the document_guid ) of the most relevant subsections.
The document-query-service would then use this document_guid to retrieve the full raw NLP JSON output from the nlp-json-cache-bucket (or the original document from raw-documents-bucket ).
Using the subsection_id and positional metadata, it would extract only the relevant subsection (or a small surrounding context) from the retrieved document/NLP output.
This extracted subsection is then returned to the user.
In summary:

The architecture provides the necessary components for this. The key is the intelligent implementation within your Cloud Run services to:

Break down documents into semantically meaningful chunks during ingestion.
Generate embeddings for these chunks.
Store these granular embeddings in Vertex AI Vector Search.
Perform query-to-subsection embedding searches.
Retrieve and present only the relevant subsection to the user.
This approach is known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) , where you retrieve highly relevant, small chunks of information to answer specific queries, rather than entire documents.

good . a document has 2 sections , each of which as 3 subsections , each of which has 5 sentences , each of which as 15 words . how many vectors are saved to vector search for this document ?
Based on our previous discussion, where we decided to generate embeddings at the "subsection" level for granular search, here's the calculation:

Sections: 2
Subsections per Section: 3
Total number of subsections = 2 sections * 3 subsections/section = 6 subsections

Therefore, 6 vectors would be saved to Vertex AI Vector Search for this document, as each subsection would have its own embedding.

good . and does the metadata for those 6 vectors look like document_guid.section_guid.subsection_guid ?
Yes, that's a very good and common approach for structuring the metadata for granular embeddings in Vertex AI Vector Search.

Using a hierarchical ID like document_guid.section_guid.subsection_guid (or similar variations like document_id/section_id/subsection_id ) provides several benefits:

Uniqueness: It ensures a unique identifier for each subsection embedding across your entire corpus.
Traceability: You can easily trace any retrieved subsection back to its parent section and the original document.
Hierarchical Querying (Implicit): While Vector Search primarily does similarity on the embedding, having this structured ID allows your application logic to:
Filter results by document_guid if the user wants to search within a specific document.
Retrieve all subsections for a given document_guid if you need to reconstruct the document's structure or display multiple relevant snippets.
Potentially group results by section_guid for a higher-level overview.
Important Considerations for Metadata in Vertex AI Vector Search:

id field: Vertex AI Vector Search requires a unique id for each data point (embedding). Your document_guid.section_guid.subsection_guid would serve as this id .
metadata field (optional but recommended): You can also include additional structured metadata alongside each embedding. This is useful for filtering or enriching your search results. Examples:
document_guid : Redundant with the ID, but useful for direct filtering.
document_type : (e.g., "pdf", "markdown", "code")
section_title : The actual title of the section.
subsection_title : The actual title/first few words of the subsection.
original_file_path : Reference to the raw document in Cloud Storage.
nlp_json_cache_path : Reference to the NLP JSON in the cache bucket.
creation_timestamp : When the embedding was generated.
author : If applicable to the document.
By storing this rich metadata, your document-query-service can not only retrieve relevant subsections but also provide more contextually rich responses to the user.

good . please now make a comprehensive implementation guide in markdown including all recommended configurations
To provide a comprehensive implementation guide, I'll structure it into sections covering each part of the architecture, including recommended configurations and considerations.

4. Vertex AI Vector Search Configuration
Vertex AI Vector Search (formerly Matching Engine) will store and perform similarity searches on your vector embeddings.

Recommended Configuration:

Index Type: Usually Tree-AH for Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search, balancing recall and latency.
Dimensions: Must match the output dimensions of the Vertex AI Embeddings API (e.g., 768 for text-embedding-004 ).
Distance Measure: DOT_PRODUCT or COSINE are common for text embeddings. DOT_PRODUCT is often preferred when embedding models are trained to optimize for it.
Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) Configuration: Tune parameters like leaf_node_embedding_count and leaf_nodes_to_search to balance recall and latency.
Metadata Filtering: While the primary use is similarity, you can define numeric_restricts or string_restricts if you want to filter searches based on metadata (e.g., search only documents of a certain type). This means you'd pass metadata alongside your embeddings when indexing.
Implementation Steps (Code within document-ingestion-service ):

Create Index: Define the index structure.
Upload Data: When ingesting a document, create a list of data points, each containing:
id : Your unique document_guid.section_guid.subsection_guid .
embedding : The vector generated by Vertex AI Embeddings API.
restricts (optional): Key-value pairs for metadata filtering.
Example Python Snippet (Conceptual, part of ingestion service):

```python
from google.cloud import aiplatform

# Initialize Vertex AI client
aiplatform.init(project="stharrold-yuimedi", location="us-central1")

# --- Index Creation (usually done once, or via Infrastructure as Code) ---
# This is a simplified example. Refer to Vertex AI Vector Search documentation
# for full index creation options.
my_index = aiplatform.MatchingEngineIndex.create_tree_ah_index(
    display_name="document_subsection_embeddings",
    contents_delta_uri="gs://your-temp-bucket-for-index-data", # Temporary bucket for data batching
    dimensions=768, # Example dimension for text-embedding-004
    approximate_config=aiplatform.MatchingEngineIndex.ApproximateConfig(
        leaf_node_embedding_count=500, # Tune based on dataset size
        leaf_nodes_to_search=10 # Tune for recall/latency
    ),
    distance_measure_type="DOT_PRODUCT"
)

# --- Data Upload (per subsection in ingestion service) ---
def upsert_embedding_to_vector_search(subsection_id, embedding_vector, document_metadata={}):
    data_points = [
        aiplatform.MatchingEngineIndex.DataPoint(
            id=subsection_id,
            embedding=embedding_vector,
            # If you want to filter searches, add restricts here:
            # restricts=[
            #     aiplatform.MatchingEngineIndex.DataPoint.Restriction(
            #         namespace="document_type", allow_list=["pdf"]
            #     )
            # ]
        )
    ]
    # Get index endpoint (after deployment)
    index_endpoint = aiplatform.MatchingEngineIndexEndpoint("your_index_endpoint_id")
    index_endpoint.upsert_data(data_points)
```

5. Cloud Run Service: Document Ingestion Service
This service processes new documents, performs NLP, generates embeddings, and updates caches/vector search.

Deployment Configuration:

Region: us-central1 .
Memory: 1-2 GB (adjust based on document size and complexity of parsing).
CPU: 1-2 CPUs.
Concurrency: Tune based on expected load (e.g., 80 for Python services).
Timeout: Increase if processing large documents takes time (e.g., 300 seconds).
VPC Connector: Required to access Memorystore for Redis.
Service Account: A dedicated service account with permissions for:
storage.objects.get , storage.objects.create (for GCS buckets)
language.googleapis.com (for Natural Language API)
aiplatform.googleapis.com (for Vertex AI Embeddings API and Vector Search)
redis.client (if you were to write to Redis from here, though we cache queries in the other service)
Core Logic:

Trigger: Can be triggered by:
Cloud Storage Event Notification: Directly invoke the Cloud Run service on new object creation in raw-documents-stharrold-yuimedi . (Simplest for direct file upload).
Cloud Pub/Sub: Object Finalize event in GCS publishes to Pub/Sub topic, which triggers the Cloud Run service. (More robust for complex workflows/retries).
Document Parsing: Based on file extension (MP4, PDF, DOCX, etc.):
MP4: Use Video Intelligence API (for transcriptions via Speech-to-Text) and potentially object detection.
PDF/DOCX/XLSX/PPTX: Use Document AI processors for text extraction and structural understanding.
Code/Markdown: Use custom parsers/libraries in your code to extract relevant text and identify subsections.
Subsectioning: Break down the extracted text into logical subsections (e.g., paragraphs, code blocks, bullet points). Each subsection needs a unique document_guid.section_guid.subsection_guid identifier.
Natural Language API Call: For each subsection's text, call the Natural Language API.
Response Storage: Store the raw JSON response in gs://nlp-json-cache-stharrold-yuimedi/{document_guid}/{subsection_id}.json .
Vertex AI Embeddings API Call: For each subsection's text, call the Vertex AI Embeddings API to get its vector embedding.
Vertex AI Vector Search Update: Upsert the (subsection_id, vector_embedding) pair to your Vertex AI Vector Search index. Include any relevant metadata (e.g., document_guid , subsection_id , section_title ).
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling, retries, and logging (to Cloud Logging).
6. Cloud Run Service: Document Query Service
This service handles incoming user queries, performs cache lookups, executes vector searches, and formats responses.

Deployment Configuration:

Region: us-central1 .
Memory: 512 MB - 1 GB.
CPU: 1 CPU.
Concurrency: High (e.g., 200).
VPC Connector: Required to access Memorystore for Redis.
Service Account: A dedicated service account with permissions for:
aiplatform.googleapis.com (for Vertex AI Embeddings API and Vector Search query)
redis.client (for Memorystore for Redis)
storage.objects.get (to retrieve cached NLP JSON or raw documents)
Core Logic:

Receive Query: Expose an HTTP endpoint (e.g., /query ) to receive user query strings.
Redis Cache Lookup:
Use the query string as a key to check Memorystore for Redis .
If a cached result (list of document_guid and subsection_id pairs) is found, return it immediately.
Query Embedding: If not in cache, call the Vertex AI Embeddings API to get the vector embedding of the user's query string.
Vertex AI Vector Search Query:
Use the query embedding to perform a similarity search against your document_subsection_embeddings index in Vertex AI Vector Search .
Request a specified number of top results (e.g., top 5 or 10 closest subsections).
Result Retrieval & Formatting:
For each returned subsection ID:
Retrieve the corresponding raw NLP JSON from gs://nlp-json-cache-stharrold-yuimedi/{document_guid}/{subsection_id}.json .
Extract the relevant text content or parsed NLP entities from this JSON.
Format the response to the user, typically including the subsection text, a link to the original document, and confidence scores from the vector search.
Redis Cache Storage: Store the (query_string, list_of_result_ids) in Memorystore for Redis with an appropriate TTL (Time-To-Live) for cache invalidation.
Error Handling & Logging: Implement robust error handling and log to Cloud Logging.
7. Security Best Practices
Least Privilege: Grant Cloud Run service accounts only the minimum necessary IAM permissions.
VPC Service Controls: For highly sensitive data, consider setting up a VPC Service Controls perimeter to protect your services and data from exfiltration.
Secret Manager: Store any sensitive credentials (e.g., API keys if using external services) in Secret Manager, and access them from your Cloud Run services.
Network Security: Ensure proper firewall rules and network configurations (e.g., private IP for Cloud Run with VPC Connector).
8. Monitoring and Logging
Cloud Logging: All Cloud Run services will automatically send logs to Cloud Logging. Configure log sinks for aggregation and analysis.
Cloud Monitoring: Set up dashboards and alerts for:
Cloud Run request count, latency, error rates.
GCS bucket sizes and operations.
Vertex AI Vector Search query latency and QPS.
Memorystore for Redis hit ratio, memory usage, and latency.
API call quotas and usage for NLP, Video Intelligence, Document AI, Embeddings.
This comprehensive guide should give you a solid foundation for building your document intelligence solution on Google Cloud. Remember to iterate on the design, especially the subsectioning logic and embedding granularity, as you test with your specific document types.
