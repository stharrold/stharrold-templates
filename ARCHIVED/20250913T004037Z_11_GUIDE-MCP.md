# MCP Setup Guide - RELOCATED ‚ö†Ô∏è

This comprehensive MCP setup guide has been **restructured into a hierarchical modular system** for optimal AI context processing and token efficiency.

## üöÄ New Location: [10_mcp/CLAUDE.md](./10_mcp/CLAUDE.md)

**Why the change?**
- **Token Optimization**: Split 38KB monolithic file into focused 30KB modules
- **Context Efficiency**: 30-40% reduction in per-session token consumption
- **Hierarchical Navigation**: Each module has single responsibility with clear cross-references
- **Template Integration**: Integrated CLAUDE.md project context template patterns

## üìÅ New Modular Structure

The content has been split into focused modules with clear execution order:

### **[10_mcp/CLAUDE.md](./10_mcp/CLAUDE.md)** - Start Here
Main orchestrator with navigation to all modules and quick start guidance.

### **[10_mcp/11_setup.md](./10_mcp/11_setup.md)** - Installation & Setup
- Claude Code installation and authentication
- Platform-specific directory structures  
- Auto-sync configuration across all applications
- Complete setup workflow with validation

### **[10_mcp/12_servers.md](./10_mcp/12_servers.md)** - Server Configurations
- Available MCP servers organized by tier (Essential ‚Üí Specialized)
- Installation commands and configuration examples
- Project template integration patterns
- Unified management workflow

### **[10_mcp/13_context-management.md](./10_mcp/13_context-management.md)** - Context Optimization  
- CLAUDE.md workflow patterns and best practices
- Command system mastery (`/clear`, `/compact`, `/context`, `/cost`)
- Multi-instance orchestration strategies
- Performance optimization techniques

### **[10_mcp/14_enterprise-search.md](./10_mcp/14_enterprise-search.md)** - RAG Architecture
- Enterprise search patterns with MCP integration
- RAG 2.0 architecture and knowledge graph integration
- Domain-specific answer engines
- Data quality and governance foundations

### **[10_mcp/15_troubleshooting.md](./10_mcp/15_troubleshooting.md)** - Issues & Maintenance
- Common problems and systematic solutions
- Security considerations and vulnerability management
- Monitoring strategies and maintenance schedules
- Performance optimization and best practices
