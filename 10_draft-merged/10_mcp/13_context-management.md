# CLAUDE.md Context Management & Optimization

Advanced context management strategies for optimal Claude Code performance, including CLAUDE.md workflow patterns, command system mastery, and token efficiency optimization.

## CLAUDE.md Architecture Fundamentals

### Technical Architecture

CLAUDE.md files serve as markdown-based "project constitutions" that AI coding assistants automatically ingest at session start, functioning as high-priority system prompts that transform generic AI tools into project-aware development partners.

**Hierarchical Loading System:**
- **Global settings first**: `~/.claude.json` (user-level preferences)
- **Project-specific**: `.claude.json` or `CLAUDE.md` in project root
- **Subdirectory-level**: Feature-specific configurations

**Context Window Management:**
- Typical limit: 200,000 tokens for Claude Code (~500-page technical specifications)
- Optimal CLAUDE.md size: Under 30,000 tokens for best performance
- Performance degradation occurs at 50,000+ tokens (2-3x slower responses)
- Advanced practitioners report 40-60% reduction in context provision during sessions with well-structured CLAUDE.md files
- Token efficiency achieved through hierarchical organization and modular structure

### Workflow Modes

**Plan Mode** - Read-only analysis and strategy formulation
- Use `/init` command to regenerate context files
- AI scans project structure and establishes session parameters
- Safe for exploration without system modifications
- Activated through Shift+Tab twice

**Edit Mode** - Active code modifications
- Context-aware development with preserved project knowledge
- Maintains coding standards and architectural decisions across sessions
- Use `/clear` to reset conversation while preserving CLAUDE.md configuration

## Context Management Best Practices

### "Lean and Intentional" Principle

**Structure Guidelines:**
- Include only information AI needs to work effectively
- Use short, declarative bullet points rather than narrative paragraphs
- Structure hierarchically: global → project → feature-level overrides

**Content Organization:**
```markdown
# Essential Information Only
- Project conventions (not obvious defaults)
- Architectural constraints (not generic patterns)
- Team-specific workflows (not standard practices)
- Domain knowledge (not general concepts)
```

### Advanced CLAUDE.md Patterns

**Hierarchical Organization:**
- Parent directories provide broad context
- Child directories contain specific implementation details
- Prevents instruction bleeding between unrelated areas

**Dynamic Context Loading:**
- Runtime file references for on-demand information
- Modular organization to prevent token waste
- Cross-references without full content duplication

**Token Optimization:**
- Balance comprehensive coverage with token efficiency
- Maintain core context under 30,000 tokens (per file limit)
- Reference extended documentation for on-demand loading

### Automated Validation

**Quality Control:**
```bash
# Implement pre-commit hooks to verify context file syntax
git add .git/hooks/pre-commit << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
# Validate CLAUDE.md files
find . -name "CLAUDE.md" -exec markdown-lint {} \;
# Check file size limits (30KB)
find . -name "CLAUDE.md" -size +30k -exec echo "Warning: {} exceeds 30KB limit" \;
EOF
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

**Review Processes:**
- Establish review processes for context file changes (similar to code reviews)
- Monitor for outdated information and automatically flag stale context
- Create alerts for context files exceeding optimal size thresholds

**Version Control Integration:**
- Version control context files alongside code
- Use `.gitignore` for personal preference files
- Treat context file changes as requiring peer review

## Command System Mastery

Claude Code's command system extends beyond simple text generation to provide sophisticated project management capabilities.

### Critical Commands for Performance

**Context Management Commands:**
- `/clear` - **Most critical**: resets conversation history between unrelated tasks
- `/compact` - Natural breakpoints in related work to compress context without full reset
- `/context` - Debug token usage issues and monitor context window utilization
- `/cost` - Real-time token usage monitoring for proactive management

**Development Commands:**
- `/init` - Generate initial CLAUDE.md by analyzing project structure
- `/mcp` - View and interact with configured MCP servers
- `/model` - Dynamic model switching for optimal performance-cost balance

### Optimal Workflow Patterns

#### Explore-Plan-Code-Commit Methodology

1. **Explore**: Thoroughly understand requirements before implementation
2. **Plan**: Use Plan Mode (Shift+Tab twice) for complex architectural decisions
3. **Code**: Execute implementation with full context
4. **Commit**: Generate intelligent commit messages with Git operations

#### Plan Mode (Advanced)

**Activation**: Shift+Tab twice
**Benefits:**
- Separates research from execution phases
- Restricts Claude to read-only operations during analysis
- Provides predictable responses with detailed analysis before code modifications
- Teams report 65% reduction in error rates when enforcing Plan Mode for significant changes

#### Test-Driven Development Patterns

```bash
# Generate comprehensive test suites before implementation
claude "Create test suite for user authentication module"

# Leverage Claude's ability to create edge case coverage
claude "Add edge cases for email validation tests"

# Iterate on tests and implementation together
claude "Implement user authentication to pass all tests"
```

#### Visual Iteration Workflows

- Provide screenshots for UI refinement
- Capitalize on Claude's multimodal capabilities for pixel-perfect implementations
- Enable design-to-code conversion workflows

### Multi-Instance Orchestration

Advanced teams implement parallel Claude Code sessions for complex projects using Git worktrees:

```bash
# Create parallel development streams
git worktree add ../project-feature-auth feature/auth
git worktree add ../project-feature-ui feature/ui
git worktree add ../project-security-review security/review

# Run independent Claude sessions in each worktree
# - One instance implements new functionality
# - Another performs security reviews  
# - Third generates comprehensive tests
```

This orchestration approach mirrors human development teams, with specialized roles contributing while preventing context conflicts.

## Project Template Integration

### Development Workflow Template

Based on the project template patterns, here's a structured approach to session management:

#### Starting a Session
1. Check `TODO.md` for current tasks
2. Review recent commits: `git log --oneline -10`
3. Pull latest changes: `git pull origin main`
4. Check build status: `npm run build` (or project equivalent)
5. Run tests: `npm test` (or project equivalent)
6. Use `/context` to monitor token usage

#### Making Changes
1. Create feature branch
2. Use Plan Mode for analysis: Shift+Tab twice
3. Write tests first (TDD preferred)
4. Implement feature with `/clear` between unrelated tasks
5. Update documentation
6. Create pull request with `/commit` assistance

#### Before Completing Session
1. Update `TODO.md` with progress
2. Commit all changes with clear messages
3. Push to remote repository
4. Update task status in project tracker
5. Leave notes for next session in CLAUDE.md
6. Use `/compact` to preserve relevant context

### Context Priming Strategy

Before requesting implementation, provide comprehensive background through:

**Well-structured CLAUDE.md files:**
```markdown
# Project Context
- Architecture: [specific pattern, not generic]
- Conventions: [team-specific, not obvious]
- Constraints: [technical limitations]
- Dependencies: [critical integrations]
```

**Extended Context Loading:**
- Visual mockups and design specifications
- Explicit architectural constraints and requirements
- Extended thinking triggers like "think harder" or "ultrathink" for complex problems

This front-loaded context investment reduces iteration cycles and improves first-attempt success rates significantly.

## Performance Optimization

### Token Efficiency Strategies

**Hierarchical File Organization:**
```
project/
├── CLAUDE.md                    # Project overview (30KB max)
├── features/
│   ├── CLAUDE.md               # Feature-specific context (30KB max)
│   ├── auth/
│   │   └── CLAUDE.md           # Auth-specific patterns (30KB max)
│   └── ui/
│       └── CLAUDE.md           # UI-specific guidelines (30KB max)
```

**Cross-Reference Patterns:**
```markdown
# In project/CLAUDE.md
For authentication patterns, see [features/auth/CLAUDE.md](./features/auth/CLAUDE.md)

# In features/auth/CLAUDE.md
Parent project context: [../../CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md)
Related: [../ui/CLAUDE.md](../ui/CLAUDE.md) for user interface patterns
```

### Context Monitoring

**Real-time Monitoring:**
```bash
# Check context usage regularly
claude /context

# Monitor token costs
claude /cost

# Compact when approaching limits
claude /compact
```

**Performance Targets:**
- CLAUDE.md files: < 30KB each
- Total context per session: < 100KB initial load
- Token usage: < 150K tokens for complex sessions
- Response time: < 5 seconds for context-heavy queries

### Team Coordination

**Shared Standards:**
- Consistent CLAUDE.md formatting across team members
- Agreed-upon context structure and organization
- Regular context file reviews and updates
- Shared context templates for common patterns

**Context Synchronization:**
```bash
# Sync context files across team
git add CLAUDE.md */CLAUDE.md
git commit -m "Update context files for v2.0 architecture"
git push origin main
```

## Common Commands Template

Based on project template integration:

```bash
# Development Commands (customize per project)
npm run dev           # Start dev server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run test         # Run test suite
npm run lint         # Check code style

# Context Management Commands
claude /clear         # Reset between unrelated tasks
claude /context       # Monitor token usage
claude /compact       # Compress related context
claude /init          # Regenerate CLAUDE.md

# Project-Specific Commands (example)
npm run db:migrate    # Run migrations
npm run db:seed       # Seed database
podman-compose up     # Start all services
```

## Advanced Context Solutions

### Memory Keeper Server (MCP)

Persistent state management across Claude sessions using SQLite-based storage:

```bash
# Install and configure Memory Keeper MCP Server
npm install -g mcp-memory-keeper

# Configure in Claude Code MCP settings
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory-keeper": {
      "command": "mcp-memory-keeper",
      "args": ["--database-path", "./claude_memory.db"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Key Features:**
- **Key-value storage**: Persistent project state across session resets
- **Context resumption**: Structured markdown progress tracking
- **Session handoffs**: Seamless continuation after context resets
- **Project memory**: Maintains architectural decisions and implementation plans

### Claude Context MCP Server

Advanced vector database integration for semantic code search:

```bash
# Install Claude Context for large codebase management
npm install -g claude-context-mcp

# Configure with multiple embedding providers
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "claude-context": {
      "command": "claude-context-mcp",
      "args": [
        "--embedding-provider", "openai",
        "--chunk-size", "1000",
        "--overlap", "200"
      ],
      "env": {
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "${env:OPENAI_API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Advanced Capabilities:**
- **Semantic search**: Loads only relevant code based on context similarity
- **Multi-language support**: Handles complex polyglot codebases
- **Cost optimization**: Reduces token usage by 60-80% for large projects
- **Context efficiency**: Enables navigation of projects exceeding context limits

**Usage Patterns:**
```bash
# Search for authentication-related code
claude "Find all authentication middleware implementations"

# Semantic code discovery
claude "Show me error handling patterns in API routes"

# Architecture exploration
claude "What are the database connection patterns used?"
```

### State Synchronization Strategies

**External Memory Systems:**
- Redis-based task queues for multi-agent coordination
- SQLite databases for persistent project knowledge
- File-based state tracking for session resumption

**Handoff Mechanisms:**
```markdown
# Session Resume Template
## Current State
- **Task**: Authentication system refactoring
- **Progress**: Completed user model updates, working on JWT implementation
- **Next Steps**: Test suite updates, integration with frontend

## Context Preservation
- Architecture decisions documented in `docs/auth-architecture.md`
- Test coverage: 85% (target: 90%)
- Dependencies: Updated jwt library to v8.5.1
```

### Large Codebase Navigation

**Three-Phase Approach for Projects Exceeding Context Limits:**

1. **Summarization Phase**
   - Generate high-level architecture overview
   - Identify key components and their relationships
   - Create navigation map of critical files

2. **Modular Focus Phase**
   - Work on isolated components within context limits
   - Use `.claudeignore` for strategic file exclusion
   - Implement tab-completion references for related code

3. **Integration Phase**
   - Combine completed modules with reference integration
   - Validate cross-component interactions
   - Generate final documentation and deployment guides

**Strategic File Exclusion:**
```bash
# .claudeignore patterns for large codebases
node_modules/
dist/
*.log
*.cache
test-coverage/
docs/legacy/
vendor/
third-party/
```
