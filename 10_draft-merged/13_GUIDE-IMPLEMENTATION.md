# MCP Implementation Strategy Guide

This guide provides a phased approach to implementing MCP servers for agentic development workflows, including enterprise search and RAG capabilities. For configuration details, see [GUIDE-MCP.md](./GUIDE-MCP.md). For credential setup, see [GUIDE-CREDENTIALS.md](./GUIDE-CREDENTIALS.md).

## Overview

Implementing MCP servers requires a systematic approach to maximize value while minimizing disruption. This guide outlines a four-phase implementation strategy with clear success metrics and milestones.

## The Agentic Development Paradigm

### Fundamental Paradigm Shift

Claude Code fundamentally transforms software development from traditional IDE-based coding to agentic, conversation-driven programming. Unlike GitHub Copilot's autocomplete suggestions or Cursor's IDE enhancements, Claude Code operates as an **autonomous development partner** capable of executing complex, multi-step workflows with minimal supervision.

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Terminal-Native Approach**: Enables sophisticated Git operations, command-line automation, and server management that GUI-based tools cannot match
- **200,000 Token Context Window**: Understands entire codebases while maintaining persistent project knowledge through CLAUDE.md files
- **Autonomous Task Execution**: Capable of complete features from conception to deployment rather than simple code completion

### Positioning Claude Code as Development Partner

Rather than treating Claude Code as a code completion tool, successful teams position it as an autonomous development partner by:

**Delegating Complete Task Sequences:**
- Assign entire features including research, planning, implementation, testing, and documentation
- Maintain strategic oversight through checkpoint reviews and approval gates
- Allow Claude to make architectural decisions within defined constraints

**Multi-Instance Orchestration for Complex Projects:**
```bash
# Example: Parallel development streams using Git worktrees
git worktree add ../project-auth feature/authentication
git worktree add ../project-ui feature/user-interface  
git worktree add ../project-tests feature/test-suite

# Run independent Claude sessions:
# Instance 1: Implements authentication system
# Instance 2: Builds UI components
# Instance 3: Generates comprehensive tests
```

This orchestration mirrors how human development teams operate, with specialized roles contributing to the final product.

### Context Priming Strategy

**Front-Loaded Context Investment:**
Before requesting implementation, successful teams provide comprehensive background through:

1. **Well-Structured CLAUDE.md Files**: Project conventions, architectural patterns, coding standards
2. **Visual Mockups**: UI designs, wireframes, user flow diagrams
3. **Explicit Architectural Constraints**: Technology choices, performance requirements, security policies
4. **Extended Thinking Triggers**: Keywords like "think harder" or "ultrathink" allocate additional computational resources

**Results:** This strategy reduces iteration cycles and improves first-attempt success rates by 40-60%.

### Strategic Model Selection

**Claude Sonnet 4 ($3/million tokens):**
- Optimal for 80% of development tasks
- Consistent performance under load
- Best balance of quality and cost

**Claude Opus 4 ($15/million tokens):**
- Complex architectural decisions and multi-step implementations
- Superior reasoning justifies 5x cost premium
- More rate limiting but better results for refactoring

**Claude Haiku ($0.80/million tokens):**
- Simple, repetitive tasks where speed matters more than sophistication
- Bulk operations and data transformation

**Dynamic Model Switching:**
```bash
# Switch based on task complexity
claude /model sonnet-4    # Default for most work
claude /model opus-4      # Complex architecture decisions
claude /model haiku       # Simple operations
```

## Enterprise Search & RAG Implementation

This section provides a systematic approach to implementing enterprise search and RAG capabilities using MCP servers, addressing the unique challenges of enterprise data environments.

### Phase 1: Data Census & Governance Foundation

**Objective**: Establish data quality foundation before implementing any retrieval systems.

**Critical First Step: Data Inventory**
```bash
# Deploy data census MCP server
claude mcp add data-census "python -m enterprise_data_census" \
  --env SCAN_SOURCES="confluence,sharepoint,wikis,gdrive,slack" \
  --env OUTPUT_FORMAT="knowledge_graph"

# Generate comprehensive data map
claude /task "Run complete data census and generate ownership matrix"
```

**Data Quality Assessment:**
1. **Version Control Analysis**: Identify multiple versions of critical documents
2. **Ownership Mapping**: Assign data stewards to each knowledge domain
3. **Staleness Detection**: Flag outdated content based on last-modified dates
4. **Shadow Document Discovery**: Find employee-created duplicates and consolidate

**Governance Framework:**
- **Knowledge Managers**: Dedicated roles for critical information curation
- **Update Cadences**: Regular refresh cycles for time-sensitive content
- **Access Controls**: Fine-grained permissions respecting source systems
- **Quality Metrics**: Measurable standards for information accuracy and completeness

### Phase 2: Hybrid Retrieval Infrastructure

**Objective**: Build robust multi-method retrieval system that overcomes enterprise signal poverty.

**Three-Layer Architecture Implementation:**
```bash
# Layer 1: BM25 for exact matching
claude mcp add bm25-search "python -m bm25_server" \
  --env INDEX_PATH="./enterprise_bm25.index" \
  --env TOKENIZER="enterprise_specific"

# Layer 2: Dense embeddings for semantic similarity
claude mcp add vector-search "python -m vector_search_server" \
  --env MODEL="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2" \
  --env VECTOR_DB="pinecone://enterprise-embeddings"

# Layer 3: Knowledge graph traversal
claude mcp add graph-traversal "python -m kuzu_graph_server" \
  --env GRAPH_PATH="./enterprise_knowledge.db" \
  --env TRAVERSAL_DEPTH="3"
```

**Instructable Reranker Configuration:**
```yaml
# enterprise_rerank_rules.yaml
business_logic:
  pharmaceutical:
    - condition: "document_type == 'FDA_APPROVED'"
      boost: 2.0
      priority: 1
  legal:
    - condition: "author_role == 'senior_partner'"
      boost: 1.5
  engineering:
    - condition: "last_updated < 30_days"
      boost: 1.2
    - condition: "has_code_examples == true"
      boost: 1.3
```

**Hard-Negative Mining Setup:**
```bash
# Improve disambiguation between similar documents
claude mcp add hard-negative-miner "python -m hard_negative_trainer" \
  --env TRAINING_DATA="./enterprise_query_pairs.json" \
  --env MODEL_PATH="./custom_enterprise_embeddings"
```

### Phase 3: Curated Answer Engine Development

**Objective**: Build domain-specific, trustworthy answer systems with predictable failure modes.

**Domain-Specific Engine Architecture:**

**HR Policy Engine:**
```bash
claude mcp add hr-answer-engine "python -m domain_answer_engine" \
  --env DOMAIN="hr" \
  --env SOURCES="hr_policies,employee_handbook,benefits_guide" \
  --env REQUIRE_CITATIONS="true" \
  --env UNKNOWN_RESPONSE="enabled"
```

**IT Support Engine:**
```bash
claude mcp add it-support-engine "python -m domain_answer_engine" \
  --env DOMAIN="it_support" \
  --env SOURCES="technical_docs,troubleshooting_guides,system_manuals" \
  --env STEP_BY_STEP="true" \
  --env ESCALATION_TRIGGERS="./it_escalation_rules.json"
```

**Legal Compliance Engine:**
```bash
claude mcp add legal-engine "python -m domain_answer_engine" \
  --env DOMAIN="legal" \
  --env SOURCES="regulatory_docs,compliance_guides,audit_reports" \
  --env AUDIT_TRAIL="required" \
  --env CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD="0.95"
```

**Implementation Pattern for Each Engine:**
1. **Curated Source Corpus**: Vetted, up-to-date documents only
2. **Citation Requirements**: All responses must include source references
3. **"I Don't Know" Training**: Explicit training to refuse when uncertain
4. **FAQ Bank Integration**: Pre-written expert answers for common queries
5. **Confidentiality Filters**: Prevent sensitive data leakage

### Phase 4: Agentic Workflow Implementation

**Objective**: Enable multi-hop reasoning and complex task automation using enterprise knowledge.

**Multi-Hop Architecture:**
```bash
# Agent orchestrator with retrieval tools
claude mcp add enterprise-agent "python -m agentic_orchestrator" \
  --env TOOLS="search,graph_query,document_parse,synthesize" \
  --env WORKFLOW_GRAPHS="./enterprise_workflows/"
  --env HUMAN_CHECKPOINTS="true"
```

**Example Workflow: Q3 Planning Analysis**
```yaml
# q3_planning_workflow.yaml
workflow:
  name: "Q3 Planning Analysis"
  steps:
    - name: "gather_meeting_notes"
      tool: "search"
      query: "Q3 planning meetings product roadmap"
      filters: ["meeting_notes", "last_30_days"]
    
    - name: "cross_reference_slack"
      tool: "slack_search" 
      query: "Q3 product decisions architecture changes"
      channels: ["#product", "#engineering"]
    
    - name: "check_project_tickets"
      tool: "jira_query"
      jql: "project = PRODUCT AND labels = Q3"
    
    - name: "synthesize_narrative"
      tool: "llm_synthesis"
      context: ["meeting_notes", "slack_discussions", "project_tickets"]
      output: "risk_and_decision_summary"

  checkpoints:
    - after: "gather_meeting_notes"
      action: "human_review"
    - after: "synthesize_narrative" 
      action: "stakeholder_approval"
```

**DAG Encoding for Reliability:**
```python
# Enterprise workflow DAG
from enterprise_workflows import WorkflowDAG

dag = WorkflowDAG("enterprise_search_workflow")
dag.add_node("data_retrieval", tools=["search", "graph_query"])
dag.add_node("content_analysis", depends_on=["data_retrieval"])
dag.add_node("synthesis", depends_on=["content_analysis"])
dag.add_human_checkpoint(after="content_analysis")
```

```bash
# Build enterprise-specific evaluation suite
claude mcp add eval-framework "python -m enterprise_eval" \
  --env GOLD_STANDARD="./versioned_knowledge_snapshot/" \
  --env EVAL_TYPES="answerable,unanswerable,multimodal" \
  --env COMPARISON_METHOD="pairwise_llm_judge"
```

**Evaluation Categories:**
1. **Answerable Questions**: Standard information retrieval queries
2. **Intentionally Unanswerable**: Questions designed to test "I don't know" responses
3. **Multi-hop Reasoning**: Questions requiring synthesis across multiple sources
4. **Procedural Queries**: Step-by-step process questions
5. **Contextual Disambiguation**: Questions where context determines meaning

**Continuous Improvement Loop:**
- **Weekly Evaluation Runs**: Automated benchmark testing against knowledge snapshot
- **User Feedback Integration**: Human rating collection for query quality
- **Failure Mode Analysis**: Systematic review of incorrect or incomplete responses
- **Model Retraining**: Periodic updates based on enterprise-specific patterns

This phased approach ensures that enterprise search implementation builds systematically on solid data foundations, addressing the core challenge that enterprise search is fundamentally a data governance problem that happens to use AI, not an AI problem that happens to involve data.

## Usage Limits Management & Session Optimization

### Understanding Usage Constraints

**Critical Limitation:** Usage limits represent Claude Code's most significant operational challenge. Even Max plan subscribers ($200/month) encounter:
- **5-hour session limits** that can interrupt critical development work
- **Weekly usage caps** that affect sustained development
- **Rate limiting** during peak usage periods

### Session Optimization Strategies

**Optimal Session Patterns:**
```bash
# Monitor usage proactively
claude /cost

# Implement strategic clearing patterns
# 5-10 message conversations before reset
claude /clear  # Between unrelated tasks
claude /compact  # Natural breakpoints in related work

# Principle: "clear early, clear often"
```

**Context Management for Performance:**
- Break large projects into focused sessions with clear objectives and bounded scope
- Maintain 5-10 message conversations followed by context reset
- Front-load context in CLAUDE.md files for reuse across sessions
- Use hierarchical CLAUDE.md system: Global preferences in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, project-specific files for implementation details

**Cost-Effective Workflows:**
- **Parallel Processing**: Run multiple Claude instances via Git worktrees to distribute token usage
- **Headless Mode Batch Processing**: Receives 50% discounts on API pricing for large-scale migrations
- **Prompt Caching**: 90% cost reduction for repeated patterns ($0.30/million vs $3.00/million)
- **Strategic Compaction**: Avoid costly context compaction operations that temporarily degrade performance

**Performance Management:**
Teams report that proper usage management reduces costs by 40-60% while maintaining or improving productivity through:
- Aggressive clearing patterns between unrelated tasks
- Strategic use of compaction for natural breakpoints

- Efficiency Gain = 40-80% depending on task type
```

## Migration from Existing Tools

### Gradual Migration Strategy

1. **Run in Parallel**: Keep existing tools while testing MCP
2. **Pilot Projects**: Start with non-critical projects
3. **Feature Parity**: Ensure MCP servers match existing capabilities
4. **Data Migration**: Plan data transfer carefully
5. **Cutover**: Switch fully only after validation

### Integration Points

- **GitHub**: Maintain existing webhooks
- **Jira**: Preserve ticket workflows
- **Slack**: Keep existing bot integrations
- **CI/CD**: Run alongside existing pipelines

## Advanced Configurations

### Multi-Environment Setup

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github-dev": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_TOKEN": "${env:GITHUB_TOKEN_DEV}"
      }
    },
    "github-prod": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_TOKEN": "${env:GITHUB_TOKEN_PROD}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Custom Server Development

For specialized needs not covered by existing servers:
1. Review MCP specification
2. Use TypeScript or Python SDK
3. Implement required tools/resources
4. Test thoroughly before deployment
5. Document for team usage
