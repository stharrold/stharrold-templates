# Implementation Workflow Patterns

Systematic four-phase approach to implementing MCP servers for agentic development workflows, including server selection, setup procedures, team onboarding, and migration strategies.

## Implementation Philosophy

### Systematic Transformation Approach

**Risk-Minimized Rollout Strategy:**
Implementing MCP servers requires a systematic approach to maximize value while minimizing disruption. This guide outlines a proven four-phase implementation strategy with clear success metrics, validation checkpoints, and rollback procedures.

**Graduated Implementation Benefits:**
- **Reduced risk** through incremental capability building
- **Team adaptation time** for learning agentic development patterns
- **Early wins** that build confidence and demonstrate value
- **Iterative optimization** based on real-world usage patterns

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

Establish core development capabilities with essential MCP servers that provide immediate productivity gains while building confidence with the agentic development approach.

### Development Workflow - EPCC Pattern

<workflow>
**Task Execution Pattern (EPCC)**
1. **EXPLORE** - Thoroughly understand requirements, examine existing code, identify constraints
2. **PLAN** - Design approach, outline changes, identify affected files and dependencies
3. **CODE** - Implement solution following conventions, include tests
4. **COMMIT** - Review changes, write descriptive commit message, push to branch

**When to Use Plan Mode**

- Activate with Shift+Tab x2 for:
  - Architectural decisions
  - Multi-file refactoring
  - Security-sensitive changes
  - Complex algorithm design
- Restricts to read-only operations during analysis
</workflow>

Integrate this tactical execution pattern within the strategic implementation phases outlined below.
