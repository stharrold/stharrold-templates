# Team Collaboration & Communication Patterns

Advanced collaboration strategies for multi-developer teams using Claude Code, including communication platform integration, workflow automation, and team coordination patterns.

## Phase 3: Collaboration Integration (Weeks 5-6)

Enable team collaboration and workflow automation through communication platforms and documentation management.

### Context Management Rules

<context_rules>

- Use `/clear` between unrelated features
- Use `/compact` after completing test files
- Maintain conversation under 10 messages
- Request Plan Mode (Shift+Tab x2) for architectural changes
- Include screenshots for UI work
</context_rules>

**Context Optimization Strategy:**
- **Clear conversations** when switching between unrelated tasks to prevent context pollution
- **Compact responses** after completing large files to reduce token consumption
- **Session management** to maintain optimal AI performance and cost efficiency
- **Plan Mode activation** for complex architectural decisions requiring systematic analysis

**Best Practices for Context Efficiency:**
```bash
# Clear conversation history between major tasks
claude /clear

# Compact after large file operations
claude /compact

# Use Plan Mode for architectural decisions
# Shift+Tab x2 to activate, then describe complex changes
```

### Servers to Install

#### Communication Platforms
**Slack MCP Server** - Team messaging integration
```bash

- Meeting notes and decision tracking
- Project roadmap and planning integration

**Atlassian MCP Server** - Jira and Confluence integration (if applicable)
```bash
claude mcp add atlassian npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-atlassian
```
**Capabilities:**
- Automated ticket creation and updates
- Project tracking and sprint management
- Documentation synchronization with Confluence
- Workflow automation between development and project management

#### Workflow Automation
**Zapier MCP Server** - Cross-platform automation
```bash
claude mcp add zapier npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-zapier
```
**Capabilities:**
- Multi-platform workflow automation
- Event-driven task coordination
- Data synchronization between tools
- Custom trigger and action configuration

**Memory Bank MCP Server** - Session continuity
```bash
claude mcp add memory-bank npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory-bank
```
**Capabilities:**
- Persistent context and knowledge retention
- Cross-session learning and adaptation
- Team knowledge sharing and preservation
- Historical decision tracking and rationale

### Setup Steps for Phase 3

#### 1. Communication Platforms Configuration
```bash
# Slack integration setup
npx @composio/mcp@latest setup slack
# Follow OAuth flow for team integration

# Notion workspace connection
claude mcp add notion npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-notion
# Configure with workspace integration token

# Atlassian integration (if using Jira/Confluence)
claude mcp add atlassian npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-atlassian
# Configure with API tokens and workspace URLs
```

#### 2. Automation and Memory Setup
```bash
# Zapier for cross-platform automation
claude mcp add zapier npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-zapier
# Configure with Zapier API key and automation rules

# Memory Bank for persistent context
claude mcp add memory-bank npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory-bank
# Configure with team-specific knowledge persistence settings
```

#### 3. Team Onboarding and Guidelines
- **Document server capabilities** and use cases for team members
- **Create usage guidelines** and best practices for team collaboration
- **Setup shared configurations** and standardized workflows
- **Establish communication protocols** for automated notifications and updates

### Success Metrics for Phase 3
- ✅ **Cross-platform workflow automation** functioning seamlessly
- ✅ **Team communication** integrated with development workflows
- ✅ **Documentation auto-generation** and maintenance operational
- ✅ **Project context retained** across sessions and team members
- ✅ **Task tracking** automated between development and project management tools

### Team Workflow Examples
- **Auto-create Jira tickets** from Slack discussions and code issues
- **Generate meeting notes** in Notion from development conversations
- **Sync GitHub PRs** with project boards and team communication
- **Automated deployment notifications** to relevant team channels
- **Cross-team knowledge sharing** through persistent memory and documentation

## Team-Specific Patterns

### Small Development Teams (2-5 developers)
- **Focus on Phase 1-2** for immediate productivity gains
- **Shared configurations** and standardized workflows
- **Minimal overhead** with essential tools only
- **Rapid iteration** and feedback cycles

### Large Development Teams (10+ developers)
- **Full four-phase implementation** for comprehensive capabilities
- **Role-based server access** and specialized tooling
- **Comprehensive documentation** and knowledge management
- **Advanced coordination** and workflow automation

### Remote and Distributed Teams
- **Enhanced communication integration** (Phase 3 priority)
- **Comprehensive documentation** and knowledge sharing
- **Asynchronous workflow optimization** with automated notifications
- **Cross-timezone coordination** through automated status updates

## Migration from Existing Tools

### Gradual Migration Strategy

#### Phase-by-Phase Tool Replacement

**Phase 1: Core Development Tools**
1. **Run in parallel** - Keep existing tools while testing MCP equivalents
2. **Pilot projects** - Start with non-critical projects for validation
3. **Feature parity validation** - Ensure MCP servers match existing capabilities
4. **Team training** - Build confidence with new workflows

**Phase 2: Advanced Tooling**
1. **Infrastructure migration** - Replace infrastructure and monitoring tools
2. **Testing automation** - Migrate testing frameworks and CI/CD integration
3. **Data migration planning** - Plan transfer of historical data and configurations
4. **Performance validation** - Ensure no degradation in critical metrics

**Phase 3: Team Collaboration**
1. **Communication platform integration** - Connect existing Slack/Teams workflows
2. **Documentation migration** - Transfer knowledge bases and project documentation
3. **Project management integration** - Connect Jira/Asana workflows
4. **Full cutover planning** - Prepare for complete migration

claude config set-cost-optimization aggressive
claude config set-model-switching automatic
claude config set-context-optimization enabled
```

**Team Performance Metrics:**
