# Enterprise Migration Timeline & Implementation Plan

Systematic 9-week migration plan for enterprise-scale Claude Code deployment with comprehensive phase-by-phase implementation, rollback procedures, and validation checkpoints.

## Migration Strategy Overview

### Systematic Enterprise Adoption Framework

**Migration Philosophy:**
Enterprise Claude Code adoption requires careful orchestration across multiple organizational dimensions: technical infrastructure, team training, security integration, and business process alignment.

**Core Migration Principles:**
- **Phased rollout** minimizing business disruption
- **Comprehensive validation** at each phase boundary
- **Automated rollback** capabilities for risk mitigation
- **Stakeholder alignment** across technical and business teams

## 9-Week Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation & Planning (Weeks 1-2)

# Infrastructure rollback (infrastructure only)
claude rollback --infrastructure-only --maintain-user-data
```

**Rollback Decision Matrix:**
- **Performance degradation >30%**: Automatic infrastructure rollback
- **Security incident**: Immediate selective rollback
