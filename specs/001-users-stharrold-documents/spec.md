# Feature Specification: Integrate Workflow Secrets MCP

**Feature Branch**: `001-users-stharrold-documents`
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "/Users/stharrold/Documents/GitHub/stharrold-templates.worktrees/feat/12-integrate-workflow-secrets/TODO_FOR_feat-12-integrate-workflow-secrets.md"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working with MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers, I need comprehensive documentation and practical examples for securely managing workflow secrets and credentials, so that I can implement secure credential storage patterns without exposing sensitive information in plaintext configuration files.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer needs to configure an MCP server that requires API credentials, **When** they follow the documentation, **Then** they should be able to install and configure secure credential storage using platform-native credential managers

2. **Given** a developer has installed a credential management tool, **When** they need to store a new API token, **Then** they should be able to use command-line tools to securely store the credential in their OS keychain

3. **Given** a developer needs to discover what environment variables an MCP server requires, **When** they follow the documented methods, **Then** they should be able to identify required variables through error messages, documentation, or source code inspection

4. **Given** a developer has stored credentials securely, **When** they start an MCP server, **Then** the server should automatically retrieve and use the encrypted credentials without exposing them in plaintext

5. **Given** a developer needs to verify stored credentials, **When** they use platform-specific verification commands, **Then** they should be able to confirm credentials are properly stored in their OS credential manager

### Edge Cases
- What happens when credential retrieval fails during MCP server startup?
- How does system handle credential rotation and updates?
- What fallback mechanisms exist when OS credential stores are unavailable?
- How are OAuth token refreshes handled automatically?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Documentation MUST provide step-by-step installation workflows for secure credential management tools
- **FR-002**: Documentation MUST include practical CLI examples showing credential storage with masked input prompts
- **FR-003**: Documentation MUST explain methods for discovering required environment variables for MCP servers
- **FR-004**: Documentation MUST provide platform-specific verification commands for macOS, Windows, and Linux
- **FR-005**: Documentation MUST include error handling patterns and fallback strategies for credential retrieval failures
- **FR-006**: Documentation MUST demonstrate OAuth 2.1 workflow implementation for enhanced security
- **FR-007**: Documentation MUST show runtime credential injection mechanisms without exposing sensitive data
- **FR-008**: Documentation MUST maintain cross-references to related security guides
- **FR-009**: Documentation file size MUST remain under 30KB for optimal AI context processing
- **FR-010**: Documentation MUST avoid duplicate content with existing security tool descriptions

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Workflow Examples**: Step-by-step practical examples demonstrating secure credential management workflows
- **Security Patterns**: Reusable patterns for credential storage, retrieval, and injection
- **Platform Commands**: OS-specific commands for credential verification and management
- **Error Handling**: Fallback strategies and error recovery patterns for credential operations
