# Implementation Plan: Integrate Workflow Secrets MCP


**Branch**: `001-users-stharrold-documents` | **Date**: 2025-09-14 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-users-stharrold-documents/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Integrate practical security workflow examples from `09_workflow-secrets-mcp.md` into existing `25_mcp-security-tools.md` to enhance documentation with step-by-step credential management workflows. Technical approach involves content analysis, deduplication, and strategic integration while maintaining file size constraints.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Markdown documentation with YAML frontmatter
**Primary Dependencies**: Existing modular guide system, hierarchical documentation structure
**Storage**: File-based documentation in 10_draft-merged/ with 30KB constraints
**Testing**: Content validation, file size monitoring, cross-reference integrity checks
**Target Platform**: AI context processing optimization, cross-platform credential management documentation
**Project Type**: single - documentation enhancement project
**Performance Goals**: Maintain 30KB file size limit for optimal AI context processing
**Constraints**: No duplicate content, preserve existing structure, maintain cross-references
**Scale/Scope**: Enhance single file (~16.8KB) with ~8KB of unique workflow examples

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (documentation enhancement - single project)
- Using framework directly? (Yes - direct markdown editing)
- Single data model? (Yes - unified documentation structure)
- Avoiding patterns? (Yes - direct file integration, no complex abstractions)

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? (N/A - documentation project)
- Libraries listed: Documentation integration utilities (content analysis, deduplication)
- CLI per library: File validation commands (size check, cross-reference validation)
- Library docs: Integrated into modular guide system with cross-references

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? (Yes - content validation tests must fail before integration)
- Git commits show tests before implementation? (Yes - validation before content merge)
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? (Adapted: Structure→Content→Integration→Validation)
- Real dependencies used? (Yes - actual file system, real file sizes)
- Integration tests for: Content integration, cross-references, file size limits
- FORBIDDEN: Content merge before validation, skipping size checks

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? (File size monitoring, validation output)
- Frontend logs → backend? (N/A - documentation project)
- Error context sufficient? (Clear validation failure messages)

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? (Documentation version in YAML frontmatter)
- BUILD increments on every change? (Yes - version tracking in frontmatter)
- Breaking changes handled? (Cross-reference validation, archive with timestamps)

```

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project) - Documentation enhancement project using existing modular guide structure

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md)
- Content analysis task → validate source uniqueness [P]
- Documentation enhancement task → integrate workflow examples
- Size validation task → monitor file size compliance
- Cross-reference task → maintain navigation integrity
- Quality assurance task → run validation suite
- Archive task → move source to ARCHIVED/ with timestamp

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Documentation TDD: Validation before integration
- Dependency order: Analysis → Enhancement → Validation → Archive
- Mark [P] for parallel validation tasks (size check, cross-ref check, content analysis)
- Sequential: Integration must complete before archive

**Task Categories**:
1. **Pre-Integration** [P]: Content analysis, size calculation, duplication detection
2. **Integration**: YAML update, content merge, section enhancement
3. **Validation** [P]: Size check, cross-reference test, platform command verification
4. **Quality Assurance**: Codacy analysis, content coherence review
5. **Completion**: Archive source, update tracking, prepare commit

**Estimated Output**: 15-18 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md focusing on documentation enhancement workflow

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command) - research.md generated
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command) - data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md updated
