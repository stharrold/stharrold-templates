- **Safety margin**: 4,397 bytes
- **MUST NOT exceed**: 30,000 bytes

## Cross-Reference Contract

### MUST preserve existing cross-references:
- `parent: ./CLAUDE.md`
- All entries in `related:` array
- Internal navigation links
- Tool selection matrix references

### MUST add new cross-references:
- Links to new workflow sections
- Navigation between discovery methods and tools
- Platform command cross-references
- Error handling procedure links

## Content Quality Contract

### Workflow Examples MUST include:
- Complete command sequences
- Expected output examples
- Error condition handling
- Platform-specific variations
- Security considerations

### CLI Examples MUST include:
- Exact command syntax
- Input prompting with masking
- Success/failure indicators
- Context explanations

### Platform Commands MUST include:
- OS-specific verification commands
- Expected outputs
- Common failure modes
- Recovery procedures

## Validation Contract

### Pre-Integration Validation:
- [ ] Source content analyzed for duplication
- [ ] Target file structure mapped
- [ ] Size calculations verified
- [ ] Cross-references identified

### During Integration:
- [ ] File size monitored continuously
- [ ] Duplicate content detection active
- [ ] Cross-reference integrity maintained
- [ ] Structure preservation verified

### Post-Integration Validation:
- [ ] File size within limits (< 30KB)
- [ ] All cross-references functional
- [ ] Navigation structure intact
- [ ] Content coherence verified
- [ ] Codacy analysis passes

## Archive Contract

### Source File Archival:
- **Source**: `00_draft-initial/09_workflow-secrets-mcp.md`
- **Destination**: `ARCHIVED/$(date -u +"%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ")_09_workflow-secrets-mcp.md`
- **Timing**: After successful integration and validation
- **Verification**: Source file content preserved with timestamp

### Change Tracking:
- **TODO.md**: Update issue #12 status to complete
- **GitHub Issue**: Close #12 with reference to enhancement
- **Git History**: Commit message includes integration details

## Breaking Change Prevention

### MUST NOT modify:
- Existing tool descriptions structure
- Cross-reference link targets
- YAML frontmatter keys (except version/date/changelog)
