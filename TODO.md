# TODO: Agent-Find-Tool-Workflows Integration

## Overview
Comprehensive integration of content from `00_draft-initial/07_agent-find-tool-workflows.md` into the modular guide structure in `10_draft-merged/`. This represents a breaking change (v4.0) replacing Claude-Flow with LangGraph orchestration and Docker with Podman for enhanced security and scalability.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Breaking Changes (v4.0)
1. **Orchestration Framework**: Claude-Flow ‚Üí LangGraph
   - Reason: 4.2M downloads, enterprise adoption, TypeScript native
   - Impact: All orchestration patterns updated

2. **Container Technology**: Docker ‚Üí Podman
   - Reason: Rootless security, no daemon requirements
   - Impact: All container commands and examples updated

3. **State Management**: Enhanced with Redis Cluster + Celery
   - Reason: Production-grade reliability and scalability
   - Impact: New distributed state patterns

### File Size Management Strategy
- **30KB Limit**: All files in `10_draft-merged/` must be ‚â§30KB
- **Modular Approach**: Split large content into subcategories (39a, 39b, 39c)
- **Reference Strategy**: Use descriptive footnotes, not inline URLs

### Quality Assurance
- **Codacy Analysis**: Run after each file edit
  ```bash
  ./.codacy/cli.sh analyze --tool pylint [edited_file]  # Python files
  ./.codacy/cli.sh analyze [edited_file]                # General analysis
  ```
- **Cross-Reference Validation**: Ensure all links work after updates

## Success Criteria

### Technical Validation
- [ ] All files < 30KB
- [ ] No Claude-Flow references remain
- [ ] No Docker references remain
- [ ] All cross-references updated and working
- [ ] Codacy analysis passes for all files

### Content Integration
- [ ] LangGraph patterns fully documented
- [ ] Podman security benefits explained
- [ ] 9-week timeline implemented
- [ ] Essential testing tools integrated
- [ ] OpenTelemetry stack configured

### Documentation Quality
- [ ] Version 4.0 in all modified files
- [ ] Descriptive references with footnotes
- [ ] Hierarchical file organization maintained
- [ ] Breaking change notifications clear

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise during integration:

1. **Individual File Rollback**: Each file is edited separately, allowing targeted rollback
2. **Version Control**: Tag current state before major changes
3. **Backup Strategy**: All original files remain until final archive step
4. **Testing Checkpoints**: Validate after each major section update

## Timeline Estimation

- **Remaining Work**: 6 major tasks + cross-reference updates
- **Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours for careful integration and validation
- **Critical Path**: Container patterns update ‚Üí Testing frameworks ‚Üí Performance metrics
- **Dependencies**: Cross-reference updates must be completed last

## Notes

- **User Preferences Applied**:
  - LangGraph replaces Claude-Flow completely
  - Podman replaces Docker completely (no backwards compatibility)
  - 9-week migration timeline adopted
  - Essential testing tools only (DeepEval, Hypothesis)

- **Quality Standards**: Each file edit triggers Codacy analysis for quality assurance

- **Semantic Versioning**: All breaking changes marked as v4.0 with changelog entries
