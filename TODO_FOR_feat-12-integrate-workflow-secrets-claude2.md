# TODO: Integrate Workflow Secrets MCP (#12) - Claude2 Multi-Guide Implementation

## Overview
Intelligently distribute practical security workflow examples from `09_workflow-secrets-mcp.md` across multiple topical guide files based on content alignment and logical organization.

**Implementation Approach**: This is the Claude2 method implementation using multi-guide content distribution strategy. For other approaches, see:
- TODO_FOR_feat-12-integrate-workflow-secrets.md (Speckit)
- TODO_FOR_feat-12-integrate-workflow-secrets-bmad.md (BMAD)
- TODO_FOR_feat-12-integrate-workflow-secrets-flow.md (Flow)

**Part of main roadmap**: See [TODO.md](TODO.md) for complete project status and priority context. Referenced from [TODO.md line 29](TODO.md#L29).

**Target Directory**: `/Users/stharrold/Documents/GitHub/20250909T123000Z_stharrold-templates/10_draft-merged/`

**Work Location**: Implementation being completed in `../stharrold-templates.worktrees/feat/12-integrate-workflow-secrets-claude2/`

**Implementation Notes**: This task uses the Claude2 method approach with intelligent content distribution across multiple guides. Tracked in [TODO.md line 31](TODO.md#L31) as "Claude2 Worktree: feat/12-integrate-workflow-secrets-claude2 (multi-guide distribution - in progress)".

## Multi-Guide Merge Strategy

### Content Distribution Plan

## Content Distribution Matrix

### Security-Focused Content â†’ `20_credentials/25_mcp-security-tools.md`
1. **mcp-secrets-plugin setup** â†’ "Installation" section
2. **OAuth 2.1 mcpauth workflow** â†’ "OAuth Integration" section
3. **Platform verification commands** â†’ "Verification" section
4. **Security best practices** â†’ "Best Practices" section

### Workflow-Focused Content â†’ `30_implementation/32_workflow-patterns.md`
1. **Step-by-step implementation** â†’ "Implementation Patterns" section
2. **Error handling patterns** â†’ "Error Handling" section
3. **Cross-platform workflows** â†’ "Cross-Platform Patterns" section
4. **Testing and validation** â†’ "Testing Patterns" section

### Configuration-Focused Content â†’ `10_mcp/12_server-management.md`

2. **Server lifecycle management** â†’ "Management" section
3. **Debugging and monitoring** â†’ "Troubleshooting" section
4. **Performance optimization** â†’ "Optimization" section

## Conflict Resolution Framework

### Decision Points - RESOLVED:
1. **Environment discovery methods**: âœ… OPTION 3 (Hybrid) - Quick reference in workflow patterns, detailed examples in server management
2. **Overlapping security content**: Credential storage patterns in security tools (primary), workflow patterns (reference only)
3. **Cross-references**: Brief descriptions with links for "deep dive" details
4. **Duplicate consolidation**: Keep separate perspectives, avoid true duplication through different depth levels

## Success Metrics
- [x] Content logically distributed across 3 topical guides
- [x] All target files under 30KB
- [x] No content duplication between guides
- [x] Clear cross-references between related sections
- [x] All workflow examples functional
- [x] Codacy analysis passes for all targets
- [ ] GitHub issue #12 closed (pending final commit/PR)
